# Welcome to the Scrapped Bonus Content Folder!

## Why is this here?
Simple really, i don't wanna lose any work i've done with these, but i also either
* A. Don't feel like completing them
* B. It's not turning out good and i decided to scrap it
* C. It's not worth dedicating time to finishing it

# Why are there archives of these folders, did you forget to delete the folders?

Nah, its so you can download the assets together, or seperately.

# FOLDER INFO

### Iason Mason - STILL WORKING CORRECTLY AS OF 6/4/24, ENGINE VERSION 0.8.2

I wanted to do my own version of Iason Mason because i thought it would be funny, but i kinda went nowhere with it, and fast.

### Triple Trouble Cover OG - STILL WORKING CORRECTLY AS OF 0.5.A1

This folder is from when i still ported the oldest version of my Triple Trouble cover. but due to how absolutely dog water it is, i have stopped porting it to newer versions. it now lives here!

### "Uh Char, it's already included with 0.5.A1"

Fuck you it's in here anyway, mainly because it means you don't have to extract the files from the bin archive.

### Collection of Old Char Sprite Sheets - WILL LITERALLY ALWAYS WORK, ITS JUST CHARACTER FILES AND IMAGES.

This will probs overlap a lil with the Triple Trouble assets lmao.

but yeah its just a compilation of Char sprite sheets
