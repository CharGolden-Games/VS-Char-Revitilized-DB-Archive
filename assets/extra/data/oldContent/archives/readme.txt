if this folder is here, thats an accident, this folder is meant for the github, but im not sure how to exclude folders lmao

also, FOR the github,

"Why are some files 7z.00x?"
Github's file limit requires that i don't upload anything over 100MB, or else id have to use a seperate thing for it, so i'd rather avoid it altogether.
however this does mean you will need either 7-Zip (7-zip.org) or WinRAR (win-rar.com) to extract these files.

(Windows 11 might have the ability to natively open these, but idk)
